In recent years, because of availability of huge computational power, natural language processing(NLP) has became accessible to the industries and individuals. In the field of NLP there are many techniques to retrieve the answer from structured or non-structured data. One of such use-case is retrieving answer from the logs of the software. 
Retrieving answers from a non-structured data is hard because of the complexity of refining the question, unavailability of training data and producing a universal model which can work in any context demands research.
In the industries and academia, many state of the art techniques are available for implementation. There are layers in different solutions like identifying what is to be searched, category of the question and from where to find answer. Performance of these layers can help to evaluate performance of a new approach.
